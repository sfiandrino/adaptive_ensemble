**Adaptive Ensemble**

**Introduction**

The adaptive ensemble approach combines epidemic projections from the Flu Scenario Modeling Hub across all defined scenarios. The approach leverages new surveillance data points to generate an adaptive ensemble by dynamically rejecting the subset of individual models' trajectories that do not closely match the observed trends.

**Datasets**

We consider the projections submitted to the U.S. Flu Scenario Modeling Hub during Round 1 of 2023/2024 (https://fluscenariomodelinghub.org/index.html)

**Structure of the repo**

The folder structure of the repository is as follows:
- input_data: this folder contains all the data needed to reproduce the analysis.
- scenario_modeling: this folder contains the US national level and US states level analysis. Code, figures, and output data are included.
- short_term_forecasting: this folder contains code, figures, and output data as the result of the short-term forecasting retrospective analysis.
